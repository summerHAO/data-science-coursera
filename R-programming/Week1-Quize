Question 4

If I execute the expression x <- 4 in R, what is the class of the object 'x' as determined by the 'class()' function?
Answer: numeric

Question 5

What is the class of the object defined by the expression x <- c(4, "a", TRUE)?
Answer: character
Explanation:
> x <- c(4, "a", TRUE)
> class(x)
[1] "character"

Question 6

If I have two vectors x <- c(1,3, 5) and y <- c(3, 2, 10), what is produced by the expression cbind(x, y)?
Answer: a numeric matrix with 3 rows and 2 columns
Explanation:
> x <- c(1,3, 5)
> y <- c(3, 2, 10)
> cbind(x,y)
     x  y
[1,] 1  3
[2,] 3  2
[3,] 5 10

Question 7

A key property of vectors in R is that
Answer: elements of a vector all must be of the same class

Question 8

Suppose I have a list defined as x <- list(2, "a", "b", TRUE). What does x[[1]] give me?
Answer: a numeric vector containing the element 2.

Question 9

Suppose I have a vector x <- 1:4 and y <- 2:3. What is produced by the expression x + y?
Answer: an integer vector with the values 3, 5, 5, 7.
Explanation:
> x <- 1:4
> y <- 2:3
> x+y
[1] 3 5 5 7

Question 10

Suppose I have a vector x <- c(17, 14, 4, 5, 13, 12, 10) and I want to set all elements of this vector that are greater than 10 to be equal to 4. What R code achieves this?
Answer: x[x == 10] <- 4

152 18 131 8.0 76 9 29
153 20 223 11.5 68 9 30

Question 15

What is the value of Ozone in the 47th row?
Answer: 21
Explanation:
> data[47,]
Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day
47    21     191 14.9   77     6  16

Question 16

How many missing values are in the Ozone column of this data frame?
Answer: 37
Explanation:
#Calculate how many missing data
> length(which(is.na(data)))
[1] 44
#Calculate how many missing date with column name of Ozone
> datana<-subset(data,is.na(Ozone))
> nrow(datana)
[1] 37

Question 17

What is the mean of the Ozone column in this dataset? Exclude missing values (coded as NA) from this calculation.
Answer: 42.1
Explanation:
> datanotna<-subset(data,!is.na(Ozone))
> apply(datanotna,2,mean)
    Ozone   Solar.R      Wind      Temp     Month       Day 
42.129310        NA  9.862069 77.870690  7.198276 15.534483 

Question 18

Extract the subset of rows of the data frame where Ozone values are above 31 and Temp values are above 90. What is the mean of Solar.R in this subset?
Answer: 212.8
Explanation:
> datasub18<-subset(data,data$Ozone>31 & data$Temp>90,select=Solar.R)
> apply(datasub18,2,mean)
Solar.R 
  212.8
